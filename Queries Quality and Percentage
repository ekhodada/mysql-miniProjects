There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.
