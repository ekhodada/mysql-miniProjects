Table: Delivery
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.

-- Solution:

select round(
(select count(delivery_id) from Delivery
where order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) 
/
(select count(delivery_id) from Delivery)* 100 ,2)
AS immediate_percentage
